The thoughts behind this were to follow instruction first and foremost.  After that, was to put my own flair on it.  I tried to incorporate all the things I've learned thus far in class, plus the things I've learned on my own.  It was good going through this process, becuase it allowed me to be creative.  To this point in class I've had challenges where the rules were defined.  This was my chance to complete the task as I saw fit.

 I had fun, it was trying, as I like to rack my brain and go through notes before I start to google and ask for help. I was able to use conditional statements, type conversions, functions and imputs. I'm proud of the struggle it took to create.  It took a bit longer than I wanted it to, but its finished with time to spare. So alls well that ends well.
