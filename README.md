The thoughts behind this were to follow instruction first and foremost.  After that, was to put my own flair on it.  I tried to incorporate all the things I've learned thus far in class, plus the things I've learned on my own.  It was good going through this process, becuase it allowed me to be creative.  To this point in class I've had challenges where the rules were defined.  This was my chance to complete the task as I saw fit. I actually had to make another one after reading the directions completely. I didn't want to be penalized for not following directions. Sometimes I can get ahead of myself. The Calculator_actual_project is the project I'm submitting.

The calculator starts by gathering user input for the total bill. Then the percentage you want to leave.  Then ends with a funny message.  The second calculator I made was more to what would be customary in terms of tipping.  I only allowed the user to input a preset amount. In downloading either calculator you'd be getting an efficent way to handle the ugly of splitting a bill.

 I had fun, it was trying, as I like to rack my brain and go through notes before I start to google and ask for help. I was able to use conditional statements, type conversions, functions and imputs. I'm proud of the struggle it took to create.  It took a bit longer than I wanted it to, but its finished with time to spare. So alls well that ends well.
